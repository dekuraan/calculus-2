### Colonies

in the 19th century england was #1 country bc:

- island/navy
- industrialized
- slave trade

colonies produce raw materials (cotton)
british produce industrial good (textiles)

#### British policy

no colonies could impose tariff on british goods more than 3%
britain made it illegal for skilled textile workers to leave the country

Slater "the Traitor" took industrialization techniques to the US

"champions of free trade" had tariffs before industrial revolution: to protect british textile industry

#### German policy

Infant industry argument:

1. impose high tariff on foreign imports (~40%)
2. british textiles became very expensive
3. domestic textile producers develop
4. now you have developed industry, can remove tariffs

big mistake if you keep tariffs forever, bc there is no incentive for dom industry to innovate

#### Indian textiles

india had best textile industry in the world before the industrial revolution
british copied indian designs before industrial revolution

### Nations
