## Calculus with Inverse functions

for point (a,b) on a function, point (b,a) exists on the inverse function

let f be 1-1 function
continuous at x=a
then f^-1 is cont at x = f(a)

Differentiable at a point: tangent line that is not vertical at that not point

geometrically if f(a) exists then f has a non-vertical tangent line
