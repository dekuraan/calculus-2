## Calculus with Inverse functions

### Theorem

for point (a,b) on a function, point (b,a) exists on the inverse function

let f be 1-1 function
continuous at x=a
then f^-1 is cont at x = f(a)

Differentiable at a point: tangent line that is not vertical at that not point

geometrically if f(a) exists then f has a non-vertical tangent line at (a;f(a))

as long as the tangent line is non-horizontal then the tangent line on the inverse function will exist

### theorem

suppose f is 1-1 diffable and f^-1(y) != 0

then f^-1 is diffable as well

(f^-1)'(3) = 1/(f'(f^-1(3)))

find if function is always increasing or decreasing
