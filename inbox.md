- Inverse functions are functions that undo each other
  - Ex: f(x) = x^3, g

Function: a function f(x) is one-to-one if for every output value there is only one corresponding input value.

f is one to one if x=y whenever f(x) = f(y)

f is one to one if f(x)!=f(y) whenever x != y

f is one to one if it passes the horizontal line test which every possible horizontal line passes through the graph only once

let f be a one-to-one function the nit's inverse funtion is defined by f^-1()

inverse funtion = f^-1(y)=x when f(x)=y

let f be one-to-one

Dom(f-1)=range(f)
range(f-1)=dom(f)

f@f^-1(x)=x
f^-1@f(x)=x

To invert rational funtions switch x and y then get all of the y terms on one side

[[Monotonic Function]]

if a function is monotonic is one to one

monotonic - increasing or decreasing across the entire domain

f is increasing if f(a)>f(b) when a>b

f(a) != f(b) whenever a!=b

proof

assume a!=b, a is either > or < b
