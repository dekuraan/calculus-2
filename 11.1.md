# 11.1 sequences
## Inc and dec sequences
a sequence is increasing if $a_{n+1}>a_n$ a sequence is decreasing if $a_{n+1} < a_n$
## bounded
Definition: $a_n$ is bounded above if there exists some number M s.t. $a_n \leq M$, is bounded below if $a_n \geq M$ and bounded if it is bounded both above and below
## Theorem: monotonic sequence theorem
suppose $a_n$ is monotonic (inc or dec)
if $a_n$ is increasing and bounded above then $\lim_{n\rarr\infin}a_n exists$
if $a_n$ is decreasing and bounded below then $\lim_{n\larr\infin} a_n$ exists
