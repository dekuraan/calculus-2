# 7.4 integration of rational functions by partial fractions

as long as the degree of the top of a rational function is smaller than the top you can decompose it. 

$$\frac{1}{1-x^2}=\frac{1}{(1-x)(1+x)}=\frac{A}{1-x}+\frac{B}{1+x}$$
---
$$\frac{1}{(1-x)(1+x)}=\frac{A}{1-x}+\frac{B}{1+x}$$
$$1=(\frac{A}{1-x}+\frac{B}{1+x})(1-x)(1+x)$$
$$1=A(1+x)+B(1-x)$$
$$1=A+Ax+B-Bx$$
The coefficients of the 1st degree of x ($x^1$) must be the same on both sides, therefore $Ax-Bx=0x \rightarrow A-B=0$, the same for the constants. $A+B=1$, find values that solve for these two equations ($\frac{1}{2}$).

---

because both sides are equal you can use any value of x that is convenient to leave only one coefficient remaining for solving.
