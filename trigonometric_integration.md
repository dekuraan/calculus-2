## Strategy for Evaluating $\int \sin^mx \cos^n x dx$
### Power of cosine is odd
If the power of cosine is odd $n=2k+1$, save one cosine factor and use  to express the remaining factors in terms of sine: $\int\sin^m x\cos^{2k+1}=\int\sin^m x(\cos^2x)^k\cos x dx = \int\sin^m x(1-\sin^2 x)^k \cos x$
then substitue = sin
